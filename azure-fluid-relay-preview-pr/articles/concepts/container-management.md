The atomic unit of storage in the Azure Fluid Relay service is a container. The container represents the data stored from a Fluid session, including operations and snapshots. The Fluid runtime uses the container to rehydrate the state of a Fluid session.

*Accessing Containers*
Containers are referenced by containerID. Any process with a valid JWT can access a container. It is the responsibility of the developer to generate JWTs for container access, which puts them in control of the business logic to control that access as appropriate for their scenario. The Azure Fluid Relay service has no knowledge of which users should have access to a container.

*Container Naming*
Containers are named by the Azure Fluid Relay service at container creation time. The Create action returns a container name in the form of a GUID that must be used later to open the container.

*Container Discovery*
Developers are responsible for any experience and business logic related to user discovery of existing containers. This could take the form of a browsable list of containers based on user participation in the Fluid session, direct sharing of containers between users, or programmatic assignment of containers to existing artifacts or processes.

*Container Tracking*
In most cases, developers will want to manage an inventory of containers that includes information about who has access to the containers as well as metadata like the friendly name of the container.
